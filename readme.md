Causal Set Simulation Campaign V5
Overview

This repository contains code and data for Simulation Campaign V5, an exploratory study investigating the emergence and stability of coherent structures within dynamically growing causal sets. The primary aim is to examine whether specific topological features—such as internal coherence and degree distribution—correlate with the persistence of these structures over time.

While the simulations are grounded in theoretical frameworks like causal set theory and the Free Energy Principle, this work is preliminary and does not assert definitive conclusions about consciousness or its physical correlates.
Motivation

Causal set theory posits that spacetime is fundamentally discrete, composed of elementary events ordered by causality . Some theoretical perspectives suggest that the growth dynamics of causal sets could provide insights into the nature of temporal experience .

In parallel, the Free Energy Principle offers a framework for understanding self-organizing systems through the concept of Markov blankets—statistical boundaries that mediate interactions between internal and external states . However, the conditions under which such boundaries emerge from purely relational data remain an open question.

Network science contributes additional tools for analyzing the stability and modularity of complex systems. Studies have shown that certain topological features, like high modularity and specific degree distributions, can influence the robustness of biological and ecological networks .

This simulation campaign seeks to explore these interdisciplinary connections by generating causal sets under various parameters and analyzing the resulting structures for patterns that may inform our understanding of system stability and boundary formation.
Key Findings

    Coherence-Lifespan Correlation: Preliminary analyses indicate a moderate correlation between measures of internal coherence and the lifespan of emergent structures within the simulated causal sets.

    Topological Features: Structures exhibiting compressed in/out-degree distributions tend to demonstrate greater persistence, suggesting a potential link between degree distribution and stability.

    Parameter Sensitivity: Certain parameter combinations, particularly those involving higher reinforcement probabilities, appear to favor the emergence of longer-lived structures.

    Boundary Dynamics: Initial tests suggest that some structures may exhibit delayed signal propagation across their boundaries, a feature reminiscent of causal shielding observed in other complex systems.
