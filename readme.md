# Causal Set Simulation Campaign V5

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for Simulation Campaign V5, an exploratory study investigating the emergence and stability of coherent structures within dynamically growing causal sets. The primary aim is to examine whether specific topological features—such as internal coherence and degree distribution—correlate with the persistence of these structures over time.

While the simulations are informed by theoretical frameworks like causal set theory and the Free Energy Principle, this work is preliminary and does not assert definitive conclusions about consciousness or its physical correlates.

## Motivation

Causal set theory posits that spacetime is fundamentally discrete, composed of elementary events ordered by causality. Some theoretical perspectives suggest that the growth dynamics of causal sets could provide insights into the nature of temporal experience.

In parallel, the Free Energy Principle offers a framework for understanding self-organizing systems through the concept of Markov blankets—statistical boundaries that mediate interactions between internal and external states.

Network science contributes tools for analyzing the stability and modularity of complex systems. Studies have shown that certain topological features, like high modularity and compressed degree distributions, can influence the robustness of biological and ecological networks.

This simulation campaign explores these interdisciplinary connections by generating causal sets under various parameters and analyzing the resulting structures for patterns that may inform our understanding of system stability and emergent boundary formation.

## Key Findings

- **Coherence–Lifespan Correlation**:  
  Preliminary analyses show a moderate correlation (Spearman ρ ≈ 0.48) between internal coherence and structure lifespan, suggesting a potential relationship between topological order and persistence.

- **Topological Signatures**:  
  Longer-lived clusters tend to exhibit compressed in/out-degree distributions relative to control networks, hinting at organized sparsity rather than random wiring.

- **Parameter Sensitivity**:  
  Lifespan maxima emerge in a narrow band of the parameter space, typically involving moderate instantiation probability and higher reinforcement—suggesting dynamic sweet spots.

- **Boundary Effects**:  
  Functional tests show delayed signal propagation at structure peripheries, consistent with primitive causal insulation or proto–Markov-blanket behavior.
